            <h3 class="gravityTarget">Hi! I'm Simon Snider, thanks for stopping by!</h3>
            <p class="tooLarge">I am a Computer Science Senior at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, about to graduate and earn my Bachelors of Computer Science. I've had a passion for software development since I was a sophomore in highschool. My early education in CS came from finding online classes outside of school to learn more about programming becaues my school didn't offer anything CS related. Since then my classes at Rose have given me lots of experience with both frontend and backend development using Java, C, SQL, HTML and CSS,</p>
            <p class="tooLarge">My most recent work experience was as a software developer at Keysight Technologies, where I worked on both the front-end and the middleware of one of their newer products. I gained experience using Javascript with Angular in creating user-friendly UI's with powerful functionality such as giving clients the ability to upload custom python scripts and run them on remote chassis used for testing equipment.</p>
            <p class="tooLarge">I am most experienced in using Java and C for development purposes, but I am also familiar with using Python for machine/deep learning. One area of CS that I am particularly interested in and am always excited to learn about is Artificial Intelligence and deep learning.</p>
            <p class="gravityTarget">Cheers!</p>
