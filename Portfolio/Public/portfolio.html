                    <p>Alongside team Ixia at Keysight Technologies, I helped develop the A400GE-QDD software. 
                        My contribution to the project included a new feature to upload and run user's python scripts, 
                        implementing new memory-map specifications, and updating various UI's for greater ease of use.

                    <h2>Reach-Your-Teacher</h2>
                    <p>As a part of Techpoint's S.O.S. challenge, My team and I designed an application 
                        to facilitate a safe environment for teachers and grade-school students to communicate easily 
                        while attending school virtually during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our team of six developers used
                        an agile workflow to conceptualize a product to fill a much-needed void caused by the pandemic,
                        and brought the idea into a ready-to-implement state through various mock-ups and marketing plans.

                    <h2>My-Rose-Carillon</h2>
                    <p>During an Android Application Development class, my teammate and I designed and developed to market-readiness a social media 
                        application to increase school spirit and community at Rose-Hulman. We looked at our bell-tower that rings
                        over the entirety of campus every quarter-hour and decided that, instead of playing the same tiring jingle 
                        every time, the bell tower could use the creativity of the students at Rose. My-Rose-Carrilon was a mobile
                        application that gave students the power to create songs to be played on the Bell tower and vote which one
                        should be played the next time the tower rings.
